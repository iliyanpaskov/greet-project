## Project Information

- Greetings SPA project 
- The header component contains a photo background, and current category title that changes dynamically.
- The response from API calls is presented as cards. Each one of them is a reusable component. It contains an image, name, description, all product categories, and an "Add to cart" button. When a user clicks the button it leads him to order the product destination.
- A product list with pagination is implemented with infinite scrolling.
- There are sort and filter select components. With the Filter component, a user can choose which products to display by changing the filter component value. All filter component category options are dynamically populated. By changing the Sort component value user sends new API requests and sorts all products alphabetically, and by price(ascending and descending order)
- Responsive design.
